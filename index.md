title: BETA Universe Systems Initiative Table Application
---

## About

In tabletop role-playing games, players can be burdened by extraneous calculations and player order, which disrupt the flow and narrative of the game. The BETA Universe Systems Initiative Table Application is a mobile-optimized companion web application that aims to digitize and streamline gameplay components from the tabletop role-playing game “BETA Universe Systems.” Players can register for accounts, manage player characters, and participate in game sessions that feature real-time communication via a chat log and combat loop. Gamemasters can also register for accounts, manage the non-player characters and manage game sessions along with running them.
